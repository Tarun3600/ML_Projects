# Simple Customer Churn Modeling Project using ANN

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a dataset from a bank. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The workflow is implemented in Python using popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Steps Covered

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled categorical data with one-hot encoding.
   - Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Built a machine learning model to classify customers as churned or not.
   - Used features like demographics and account balance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
   - Visualized model performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Insights

- Feature engineering and scaling improved model performance.
- Visualizations helped in understanding customer churn trends.
